Analysis
	Noise Reduction
		We first begin by defining the characteristics of Fake News, and claim that without these characteristics, an exerpt cannot be classed as such, or become ineffective to the point that we can safely ignore it
		
		Characteristics
			A statement of fact
				Fake news must appear to be fact. Opinions ("I think that the earth is flat") are not fake news even if they have no basis in reality, unless it is a statement of fact about a third party's opinion ("Trump thinks that the earth is flat")
				This author predicts that opinions can be flagged with a reasonably high degree of accuracy using a BOW model, due to the tendency of keywords (if,think,I) 
				All posts which are automatically flagged as a non-fact, can be marked as an opinion to human users

			Tendency to become viral
				Fake news must have the potential to become viral, or it will be insignificant

			Tendency to be harmful
				Fake news must damage the reputation of a named entity (Pope / Starbucks), or a group of people (Immigrants / Chinese)
				Under this definition, posts which do not attack a named entity or sub-group of humans, such as alternative facts (Global warming) are not classed as harmful
				Limitation
					Stock market crash is harmful

		Limitations
			Hybrid truth
				Fake news can quote a person out of context and assert their opinion using these quotes as a basis

			Denial in news
				A politician denies accusations in news (Richard Nixon denied his involvement in Watergate)

			Many Unverified Posts


	Strategy
		Assumption
			Posts about oneself are unlikely to be viral
			The number of sub-groups of viral posts are small enough to be able to be checked manually, and a coordinated spam attack is unlikely to be successful given modern broadcasting spam detection techniques (> 99%)
				https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231215002106
			? Ability to access relevant dataset

		Executive Summary
			This method recogonizes that fake news cannot be classified as such based solely upon its content (Elon Musk and the flying car). The same words can also be real or fake depending on context (LKY is president of Singapore).
			It is thus more reliable to implement a system of verification, by grouping similar posts together, and cross checking with trusted sources.

			Group all posts into the following categories:
				Opinion / Personal					Likely Non-fact
				Verifitable Fake News 				Likely fact, Likely Viral, Likely fake
				Verified by: XXX 					Likely fact, Likely Viral, Likely not fake, likely real
				Unverified 							Likely fact, (Likely not viral or (Likely not fake, likely not real))

			Algorithms
				AI
					Passive Reinforcement Learning for viral classification
					? Post - Article correlation
					? Post - Post correlation
				Techinical
					Post feature extraction
					Article feature extraction


		Step Breakdown
			Crunch posts which are likely to be viral
				Train algorithm first on a data set
				Continuously train algorithm on post that becomes viral using Passive Reinforcement Learning
				Demonstrate Proof of Concept

			Fake News correlation
				Check if viral post has appeared on a fake news site before (all news).
				Need to check if sentiment matches

			News correlation
				Check if viral post has recently appeared on the news (< 1 month). Old news can be omitted as they are likely to be quoted out of context.
				Need to check if sentiment matches

			Fact checking
				Flag similar viral posts together, and send to fact checking website if not classified as news or fake news after it has passed a "virality threshold"
				The usage of a threshold will either:
					Flag bots sharing amongst each other to overwhelm fact checking services
					Flag posts which are shared amongst humans, which post an identifiable threat




T = Text of Post
V = Post becoming viral
F = Post being fake
N = Post correlated with news on trusted sites
O = Post being an opinion, not fact

Assumption
	P(¬F | N) ~= 1
	P(F | N) ~= 0
	P(F | ¬N, V) ~= 1
	P(N | V, ¬F) ~= 1

P(V | T)
P(N | V)

Examine only viral texts
P(F | V) = P(F | ¬N) (P(¬N | V) + P(¬N | ¬V)) + P(F | N) (P(N | V) + P(N | ¬V))
P(F | V) = P(F | ¬N) P(¬N | V) + P(F | N) P(N | V)
P(F | V) = P(F | ¬N) P(¬N | V)

Strategy 2
	Executive Summary
		Chatbot which responds to a question, primarily for group chats

	Context
		Fake news is moving into messaging group, where discussion is less regulated and like-minded people are less likely to rebut them

		BBC

			Digital News Report
				http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/

	Proposal
		Chatbot which responds to a question / statement posed to it (@SauceMaster), with a link to a relevant article

		Take in input inquiry, search keywords in news with article to words network
